# Lintei

Lintei is a project to make Spanish political open data easier to access, browse
and build into analyses and applications.

Our name comes from the *Libri Lintei*, a collection of ancient Roman books written
on linen that listed state officials of the Roman Republic. Our aim is to honour and
extend that tradition of political record-keeping with modern tools.

We use [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) as a backend and fetch all data from the
Congress of Deputies' (Congreso de los Diputados) [public website](https://www.congreso.es/).

This is a work in progress.
